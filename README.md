# SilverFace
For the first annual NCR Global Hackathon, my team of 4 co-ops, SilverFace, was awarded for being in the top 10 finalists of nearly 400 teams for our submission of a React Native software we called FacePay. Essentially, this product would allow a POS system to no longer require a card or sign-in during transactions because it uses facial recognition to detect and identify its operating customer and charge the bill to the associated account. It mainly used Expo, Microsoft Azure Face API, Imgur API, and Outlook API.
